    * Function that takes some text, a text color, a background color, and a border, and either:
        * Returns an image that you can blit to the screen
        * Does something fancy like gradually fading in the text one letter at a time.
    * Alternately dialogue could be displayed in a news feed at the bottom
        * That could be simple, like in roguelikes
        * Or it could be fancy, gradually displaying text as described above.
